# kanboard plugin TaskDuplicationWithFiles
Adds the possibility of duplicating, also, the attached files and the coverimage, when a task is duplicated in kanboard

It is necessary to have the Coverimage plugin installed, since it not only duplicates the files, but also adds the same header image as the original job.
